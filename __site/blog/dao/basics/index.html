<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="what_is_a_dao"><a href="#what_is_a_dao" class="header-anchor">What is a DAO?</a></h1>
<p>Hey&#33; So you want to understand DAOs? Think of them as digital organizations that run themselves through code and community votes instead of having a CEO calling the shots.</p>
<h2 id="the_basics"><a href="#the_basics" class="header-anchor">The Basics</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>DAO</strong> &#40;Decentralized Autonomous Organization&#41; is essentially an organization where decisions are made collectively by its members rather than by a centralized leadership team. Imagine a company where every major decision is voted on by the community, and those votes automatically trigger actions through smart contracts—that&#39;s a DAO.</p>
<p>The &quot;decentralized&quot; part means no single person or small group controls everything. The &quot;autonomous&quot; part comes from smart contracts that execute decisions automatically once they&#39;re approved. So if the community votes to fund a project, the smart contract can automatically release the money without anyone manually processing it.</p>
<h2 id="how_daos_actually_work"><a href="#how_daos_actually_work" class="header-anchor">How DAOs Actually Work</a></h2>
<p>Think of a DAO like a digital democracy meets a vending machine. Members hold tokens that give them voting power. When someone proposes an idea—like &quot;let&#39;s fund this research project&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s change our fee structure&quot;—token holders vote. If the proposal passes, smart contracts automatically make it happen.</p>
<p>The treasury &#40;the DAO&#39;s bank account&#41; is controlled by code, not people. This means funds can only be released according to rules everyone agreed on. No one can just run off with the money.</p>
<h2 id="three_main_types"><a href="#three_main_types" class="header-anchor">Three Main Types</a></h2>
<p>There are different flavors of DAOs depending on how hands-on you want the community to be:</p>
<p><strong>Multisig DAOs</strong> are the simplest. Think of it like a bank account that needs 3 out of 5 signatures to move money. Fast decisions, but you&#39;re trusting a small group of people. Great for early-stage projects.</p>
<p><strong>Token-Based Governance DAOs</strong> give everyone with tokens a vote—one token, one vote &#40;though some use fancier voting systems&#41;. Every major decision goes through community proposals. It&#39;s more democratic but can be slower.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Models</strong> split the difference. Day-to-day operations are handled by a small multisig team for speed, but big strategic decisions go to token holders. There&#39;s often also a scientific or technical advisory board for quality control. This is what most successful DAOs eventually evolve into.</p>
<h2 id="key_components"><a href="#key_components" class="header-anchor">Key Components</a></h2>
<p>Every DAO has a few essential pieces:</p>
<p>The <strong>treasury</strong> is a smart contract holding all the organization&#39;s funds. The <strong>proposal system</strong> lets anyone submit ideas, discuss them, and vote. <strong>Execution</strong> means approved proposals automatically happen—no bureaucracy. And <strong>reputation systems</strong> track who&#39;s contributing quality work over time, often influencing their voting power or earnings.</p>
<h2 id="why_people_build_daos"><a href="#why_people_build_daos" class="header-anchor">Why People Build DAOs</a></h2>
<p>For science and research, DAOs are powerful because they enable global collaboration without borders or middlemen. Validators anywhere can participate and earn tokens. Decisions are transparent—every vote and transaction is recorded on the blockchain. The incentives align—everyone benefits when the network succeeds. And it&#39;s permissionless—you don&#39;t need permission from some committee to participate, just stake your tokens and contribute.</p>
<p>DAOs aren&#39;t perfect though. Governance can be slow when you need community consensus on everything. Early on, you need enough centralization to move fast and fix problems, but you also need to plan for progressive decentralization over time. And there are real legal and regulatory questions about tokens, securities laws, and liability that you need smart lawyers to navigate.</p>
<h2 id="the_bottom_line"><a href="#the_bottom_line" class="header-anchor">The Bottom Line</a></h2>
<p>A DAO is basically a way to coordinate people and resources without traditional corporate hierarchy. Smart contracts handle the mechanics, tokens create the incentives, and community governance makes the decisions. When done right, it&#39;s a powerful model for transparent, global collaboration—especially in fields like scientific research where you want open participation and reproducible results.</p>
<p>The key is finding the right balance between decentralization &#40;letting the community govern&#41; and efficiency &#40;being able to actually get stuff done&#41;. Most successful DAOs start more centralized and gradually hand over control as the network matures and community governance becomes more sophisticated.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what_the_code_looks_like"><a href="#what_the_code_looks_like" class="header-anchor">What the Code Looks Like</a></h2>
<p>DAOs are built with <strong>smart contracts</strong>—code that runs on the blockchain. Here&#39;s what the basic building blocks look like &#40;written in Solidity, Ethereum&#39;s programming language&#41;:</p>

<p>Someone funds a task, someone else completes it, and the payment happens automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the_key_insight"><a href="#the_key_insight" class="header-anchor">The Key Insight</a></h2>
<p>Notice how none of this code has a &quot;CEO approval&quot; step or &quot;admin must process payment&quot; function. Once deployed, these contracts run on their own. The rules are set in code, and everyone can see exactly how decisions get made and money moves. That&#39;s what makes it &quot;autonomous&quot;—it doesn&#39;t need constant human intervention to operate.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the_human_factor_yes_people_are_still_required"><a href="#the_human_factor_yes_people_are_still_required" class="header-anchor">The Human Factor &#40;Yes, People Are Still Required&#41;</a></h2>
<p>Here&#39;s the reality: DAOs aren&#39;t fully autonomous robots. <strong>People still need to take actions</strong>—vote on proposals, submit work, review results, stake tokens. The &quot;autonomous&quot; part just means the <em>execution</em> is automatic once conditions are met. Think of it like a vending machine: you still need to insert coins and press buttons &#40;human actions&#41;, but once you do, the machine automatically gives you the snack &#40;autonomous execution&#41;.</p>
<p>In a validation DAO, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Someone has to <strong>propose</strong> a validation task</p>
</li>
<li><p>Validators have to <strong>claim</strong> the task and <strong>submit</strong> results</p>
</li>
<li><p>Token holders might need to <strong>vote</strong> on disputes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Someone has to <strong>verify</strong> the work quality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The smart contract can&#39;t do any of that automatically—it just ensures that <em>when</em> these actions happen, the right consequences follow &#40;payments, slashed stakes, reputation changes&#41;.</p>

    uint votingPower &#61; sqrt&#40;tokenAmount&#41;; // Square root function

&#125;</code></pre>
<p>To get 100 votes, you&#39;d need 10,000 tokens instead of 100. This makes <strong>governance attacks much more expensive</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Something goes terribly wrong and the DAO is under attack.</p>

<p>DAOs are not trustless magic. They&#39;re <strong>trust-minimized</strong> systems that use economic incentives, cryptography, and game theory to align incentives. You still need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Active human participation</strong> &#40;voting, validating, monitoring&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Economic deterrents</strong> &#40;staking, slashing, reputation&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple layers of defense</strong> &#40;consensus, delays, emergency stops&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Progressive decentralization</strong> &#40;start centralized, gradually hand over control&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn&#39;t to eliminate all risk—it&#39;s to make malicious behavior <strong>economically irrational</strong>. When stealing &#36;100K costs you &#36;200K in stakes and lifetime reputation, most people won&#39;t try it.</p>

<p>Let me break down the technical reality of modern DAOs:</p>
<h3 id="programming_languages"><a href="#programming_languages" class="header-anchor">Programming Languages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Solidity &#40;Dominant - 80&#37;&#43; of DAOs&#41;</strong></p>
<p>Solidity is the JavaScript of smart contracts—designed specifically for Ethereum and compatible blockchains.</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

        totalVotes&#43;&#43;;

&#125;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why Solidity dominates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most mature ecosystem &#40;tools, tutorials, auditors&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Works on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC, Avalanche</p>
</li>
<li><p>Huge developer community</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most security auditors know Solidity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rust &#40;Growing - 15&#37;, mainly Solana&#41;</strong></p>
<p>Solana&#39;s blockchain uses Rust for smart contracts &#40;they call them &quot;programs&quot;&#41;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#&#91;program&#93;
pub mod dao &#123;
    pub fn vote&#40;ctx: Context&lt;Vote&gt;&#41; -&gt; Result&lt;&#40;&#41;&gt; &#123;
        let voter &#61; &amp;mut ctx.accounts.voter;
        voter.votes &#43;&#61; 1;
        Ok&#40;&#40;&#41;&#41;
    &#125;
&#125;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why Rust is growing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Better performance &#40;Solana is very fast&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>More memory-safe than Solidity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Growing in popularity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Rust over Solidity?</strong></p>
<p>Solana chose Rust because they were optimizing for raw speed. Solidity was designed specifically for Ethereum, which processes ~15 transactions per second. Solana wanted to do 65,000 transactions per second, so they needed a language that compiles to super efficient machine code. Rust gives you that performance while having built-in memory safety features that prevent entire classes of bugs.</p>
<p>The overhead question is interesting—yes, Rust is general-purpose, but that&#39;s actually the point. Solana compiles Rust down to eBPF bytecode &#40;a lightweight virtual machine format originally from Linux&#41;, which is much more efficient than Ethereum&#39;s EVM bytecode. Think of it like this: Solidity is a specialty tool designed for one specific job &#40;Ethereum smart contracts&#41;, while Rust is a professional-grade power tool that can be configured for many jobs. When you configure Rust for blockchain work, you get better performance than the specialty tool because the underlying compiler technology is more mature and optimized.</p>
<p>The trade-off? Rust has a steeper learning curve. Solidity was designed to be easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Rust forces you to think about memory management, ownership, and lifetimes—concepts that prevent bugs but make your brain hurt initially. Most projects still choose Solidity because the ecosystem is bigger and finding auditors is easier. But if you need maximum speed and you have developers who can handle Rust&#39;s complexity, it&#39;s becoming a serious alternative.</p>
<p><strong>But doesn&#39;t that make contracts harder to write?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, yes. A simple voting contract in Solidity might be 30 lines. The equivalent in raw Rust could be 100&#43; lines because you&#39;re handling memory management, account validation, and serialization yourself. However, this is where <strong>Anchor</strong> comes in—it&#39;s a framework that handles all the boilerplate for you. With Anchor, that same voting contract is back down to 30-40 lines and looks almost as clean as Solidity. </p>
<p>The real difficulty isn&#39;t the length—it&#39;s the mental model. In Solidity, you think about &quot;this contract has this data, call this function.&quot; In Rust, you think about &quot;who owns this data, how long does it live, what accounts need to be passed in, what permissions do they need.&quot; It&#39;s more upfront cognitive load, but proponents argue this catches bugs <em>before</em> deployment rather than after your DAO loses &#36;60 million. </p>
<p>So yes, Rust smart contracts are harder to write initially. But the bet is: better to struggle during development than discover exploits in production. Most teams still choose Solidity because &quot;easier to write&quot; wins when you&#39;re racing to market. Rust is for teams that prioritize performance and are willing to pay the complexity tax.</p>

<h3 id="does_a_dao_have_to_use_blockchain"><a href="#does_a_dao_have_to_use_blockchain" class="header-anchor">Does a DAO HAVE TO Use Blockchain?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Technically? No. Practically? Yes.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#39;s why blockchain is almost always used:</p>
<p><strong>What blockchain gives you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immutable records</strong>: Nobody can change past votes or transactions</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Everyone sees the same data</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trustless execution</strong>: Code runs automatically, no intermediary</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Censorship resistance</strong>: Can&#39;t be shut down by a government or company</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global access</strong>: Anyone anywhere can participate</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Programmable money</strong>: Treasury and payments handled by code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Could you build a &quot;DAO&quot; without blockchain?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, you could have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Website with voting system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Database storing votes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rules enforced by admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But this isn&#39;t really a DAO—it&#39;s just a web app with community governance. The problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Database can be hacked or edited</p>
</li>
<li><p>Admins have too much power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Server can be shut down</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not transparent &#40;who really controls it?&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Requires trust in central operators</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some projects call themselves DAOs but aren&#39;t fully on-chain. These are called <strong>&quot;DAO-adjacent&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;socially coordinated DAOs&quot;</strong>—they use Discord/forum voting and manual execution. This is cheaper but loses the core benefits.</p>

<p><strong>On-Chain &#40;Expensive but Permanent&#41;:</strong></p>

<p>When you interact with a DAO, here&#39;s what gets permanently recorded:</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">// Every transaction creates a record like this:
&#123;
    &quot;transactionHash&quot;: &quot;0x8e5a...&quot;,
    &quot;from&quot;: &quot;0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc9e7fe6e8f9&quot;,
    &quot;to&quot;: &quot;0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984&quot;,

    &quot;parameters&quot;: &#123;
        &quot;proposalId&quot;: 5,
        &quot;support&quot;: true

    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;
&#125;</code></pre>
<p>This record is <strong>permanent and public</strong>. Anyone can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>See that address 0x742d... voted yes on proposal 5</p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify it was included in block 18234567</p>
</li>
<li><p>Confirm it happened at that exact timestamp</p>
</li>
<li><p>Audit that the gas was paid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But they CAN&#39;T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>See your real identity &#40;just your wallet address&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the vote after the fact</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete the record</p>
</li>

<p>Let&#39;s look at a real validation DAO:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">On-Chain Costs &#40;Polygon, cheap L2&#41;:
├─ Deploy smart contracts: \&#36;50-200 &#40;one-time&#41;
├─ Submit proposal: \&#36;0.10 per proposal
├─ Vote on proposal: \&#36;0.05 per vote
├─ Claim validation task: \&#36;0.08
├─ Submit results: \&#36;0.12
├─ Update reputation: \&#36;0.15
└─ Withdraw funds: \&#36;0.20

Total per validation cycle: ~\&#36;0.50-0.70

Off-Chain Costs &#40;Traditional&#41;:
├─ Website hosting: \&#36;20/month &#40;Vercel&#41;
├─ IPFS pinning: \&#36;10/month &#40;Pinata&#41;
├─ Database for UI: \&#36;30/month &#40;MongoDB&#41;
├─ RPC calls: \&#36;50/month &#40;Alchemy&#41;
└─ Discord bots: Free

Total off-chain: ~\&#36;110/month</code></pre>
<p>If you did everything on-chain &#40;including file storage&#41;, costs would be 1000x higher&#33;</p>
<h3 id="are_records_automatically_stored"><a href="#are_records_automatically_stored" class="header-anchor">Are Records Automatically Stored?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Yes and No:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s automatic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every transaction is automatically recorded on blockchain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Block explorers &#40;Etherscan, Polygonscan&#41; automatically index everything</p>
</li>
<li><p>Node operators automatically store the full chain history</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can always retrieve any past transaction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#39;s NOT automatic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Off-chain data &#40;IPFS files&#41; needs active &quot;pinning&quot; or it disappears</p>
</li>
<li><p>Frontend needs to be actively hosted &#40;website can go down&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discord/forum discussions aren&#39;t archived unless someone does it</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to pay for IPFS pinning services or run your own node</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example of permanence:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This transaction from 2016 is still viewable today:
// The first DAO hack that stole \&#36;60M

<h2 id="the_reality_check"><a href="#the_reality_check" class="header-anchor">The Reality Check</a></h2>
<p><strong>A modern DAO is typically:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>20&#37; on-chain &#40;smart contracts in Solidity, on Polygon/Ethereum&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>30&#37; off-chain infrastructure &#40;IPFS, databases, APIs&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>30&#37; frontend &#40;React website, mobile app&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>20&#37; community &#40;Discord, documentation, support&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical actions are on-chain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Voting on proposals</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moving treasury funds</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing protocol parameters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Token transfers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Everything else is off-chain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discussion and debate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Marketing and communications</p>
</li>
<li><p>User support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The blockchain is expensive and slow, so you only put the <strong>absolutely critical trust-requiring parts</strong> on-chain. Everything else runs on normal servers and saves 99&#37; on costs.</p>
