<h2 id="whats_a_distributed_system"><a href="#whats_a_distributed_system" class="header-anchor">What&#39;s a Distributed System?</a></h2>
<p>A distributed system is multiple computers &#40;nodes&#41; working together to appear as a single coherent system. Think of it like parallel computing, but instead of cores on one machine, you have independent machines connected by a network.</p>
<p><strong>The graph view</strong>: You can model any distributed system as a graph where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nodes</strong> &#61; machines/processes</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Edges</strong> &#61; communication channels &#40;network links&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Edge weights</strong> &#61; latency, or reliability &#40;probability of message delivery&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Node states</strong> &#61; current local state of each machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key challenges are fundamentally different from single-machine systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Partial failures</strong>: Some nodes can fail &#40;node removal from graph&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Network unreliability</strong>: Edges can fail or have variable latency &#40;edge failures, changing weights&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No global clock</strong>: You can&#39;t assume synchronized time across nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Network partitions</strong>: The graph can split into disconnected components</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_core_problem_consensus"><a href="#the_core_problem_consensus" class="header-anchor">The Core Problem: Consensus</a></h2>
<p>When you have multiple nodes, how do they agree on a shared state? This is the <strong>consensus problem</strong>.</p>
<p>In ML terms, imagine training a model across multiple machines - you need to agree on parameter updates. But what if some machines are malicious or fail mid-computation?</p>
<p><strong>Graph interpretation</strong>: Consensus is about reaching agreement across all nodes in the graph despite:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Node failures &#40;vertices disappearing&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Message loss &#40;edges failing&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Network partitions &#40;graph splitting into disconnected components&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge: Each node only has a <strong>local view</strong> of the graph. It doesn&#39;t know which other nodes are alive, which messages were lost, or if the graph is partitioned. Yet all nodes must converge to the same decision.</p>
<h3 id="the_cap_theorem"><a href="#the_cap_theorem" class="header-anchor">The CAP Theorem</a></h3>
<p>You can only pick 2 of 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>C</strong>onsistency: All nodes see the same data</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A</strong>vailability: Every request gets a response</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>P</strong>artition tolerance: System works despite network splits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since network partitions <em>will</em> happen, you&#39;re really choosing between C and A.</p>
<p><strong>Graph view</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Partition</strong> &#61; graph splits into disconnected components</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong> &#61; all reachable nodes in the graph have the same state</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Availability</strong> &#61; every reachable node can respond to queries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the graph partitions, you must choose: Do nodes in different components give the same answer &#40;C&#41; or do they all respond, possibly with different answers &#40;A&#41;?</p>

<h3 id="two-phase_commit_2pc"><a href="#two-phase_commit_2pc" class="header-anchor">Two-Phase Commit &#40;2PC&#41;</a></h3>
<p>Coordinator asks all nodes: &quot;Can you commit?&quot; Then either commits or aborts everywhere.</p>
<p>Problem: If coordinator fails after some nodes commit, you&#39;re stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Graph view</strong>: This is a star topology - coordinator at center, all others at edges. Single point of failure at the hub. If hub fails, the graph becomes disconnected and protocol stalls.</p>
<h3 id="paxos_raft"><a href="#paxos_raft" class="header-anchor">Paxos &amp; Raft</a></h3>
<p>More fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. Raft is basically &quot;Paxos for humans&quot; - easier to understand and implement.</p>
<p>Key idea: Elect a leader, leader decides the order of operations, followers replicate. If leader fails, elect a new one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#39;s Raft?</strong></p>
<p>Raft is a consensus algorithm designed explicitly to be understandable. The authors literally said &quot;Paxos is too hard to teach and implement, let&#39;s make something clearer.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The core idea</strong>: Strong leader model with three explicit roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Leader</strong>: Handles all client requests, tells everyone else what to do</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Follower</strong>: Passively replicates what the leader says</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Candidate</strong>: Trying to become the new leader during an election</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graph view</strong>: Raft creates a <strong>dynamic star topology</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leader is the hub, followers are spokes</p>
</li>
<li><p>All communication flows through the leader &#40;hub&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>When leader fails, the graph reconfigures with a new hub via election</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is why it&#39;s simpler than Paxos - the topology is always a star, just with different centers over time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Normal operation</strong> &#40;leader exists&#41;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Client sends request to leader</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leader appends to its log, sends to all followers &#40;hub → spokes&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once majority confirms &#40;majority of spokes respond&#41;, leader commits</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leader responds to client</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Leader election</strong> &#40;leader crashed &#61; hub disappeared&#41;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Followers have timeouts; if no heartbeat, become candidate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Candidate votes for itself, asks others for votes &#40;attempting to become new hub&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Needs majority to win; includes randomized timeouts to avoid ties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winner becomes leader &#40;new hub&#41;, starts sending heartbeats</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Log replication</strong> &#40;keeping consistent&#41;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each log entry has: term number &#40;election cycle&#41; &#43; command &#43; index</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leader never overwrites its log, only appends</p>
</li>
<li><p>If follower&#39;s log conflicts, leader forces follower to match</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Graph property</strong>: This ensures all paths from leader eventually carry identical information</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s clearer than Paxos:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paxos: Any node can propose &#40;fully connected graph behavior&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Raft: Only leader proposes &#40;enforced star topology&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paxos: Multiple roles can overlap &#40;proposer/acceptor/learner&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Raft: Clean state machine, explicit transitions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paxos: Must handle learning previous decisions via complex rules</p>
</li>
<li><p>Raft: Logs are append-only and always flow from leader → followers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safety guarantee</strong>: If two logs contain an entry at the same index and term, they&#39;re identical up to that point. This comes from the election restriction: a candidate can only win if its log is at least as up-to-date as a majority.</p>
<p><strong>Quorum requirement</strong>: Leader needs responses from majority of nodes. In graph terms, it needs to reach more than half the vertices. This ensures any two majorities &#40;quorums&#41; overlap by at least one node, preventing split-brain scenarios even during partitions.</p>

<p>In practice, Raft is used in etcd &#40;Kubernetes&#41;, Consul, CockroachDB, and many other production systems. It&#39;s become the go-to consensus algorithm because developers can actually understand and correctly implement it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#39;s Paxos?</strong></p>
<p>Paxos is Leslie Lamport&#39;s algorithm for getting multiple machines to agree on a single value, even when some machines crash or messages get lost.</p>
<p>The intuition: Imagine trying to pick a restaurant with friends via text, but some messages arrive late or not at all. Paxos solves this through rounds of proposals and voting:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prepare phase</strong>: &quot;I propose restaurant X with proposal number N&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Promise phase</strong>: Others respond: &quot;OK, I haven&#39;t seen a higher proposal number, I promise to reject anything lower&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accept phase</strong>: If enough promises, send &quot;Accept restaurant X&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accepted phase</strong>: Once majority accepts, decision is final</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The clever bit: Proposal numbers ensure that even if multiple people try to lead simultaneously &#40;split brain&#41;, the system converges to one decision. Higher proposal numbers always win.</p>
<p>It&#39;s notoriously tricky to understand and implement correctly, which is why Raft was created - it does essentially the same thing but with clearer roles &#40;leader/follower/candidate&#41; and explicit state machines.</p>
<p><strong>What algorithms does it use?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s actually pretty straightforward - just state machines and message passing&#33; Nothing fancy like graph algorithms or dynamic programming. The core is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monotonically increasing proposal numbers &#40;think: logical clocks, like Lamport timestamps&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Majority voting &#40;quorum &#61; \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1\) nodes&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>State tracking &#40;remember highest proposal seen&#41;</p>
</li>

<h3 id="byzantine_fault_tolerance_bft"><a href="#byzantine_fault_tolerance_bft" class="header-anchor">Byzantine Fault Tolerance &#40;BFT&#41;</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#39;s BFT?</strong></p>
<p>BFT stands for <strong>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</strong> - it&#39;s the property of a system that can tolerate Byzantine faults and still reach consensus. A BFT algorithm guarantees that honest nodes will agree on a value even when some nodes are Byzantine.</p>
<p><strong>PBFT</strong> &#40;Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance&#41; is a specific BFT algorithm from 1999 that made BFT efficient enough for real systems. Before PBFT, BFT algorithms were too slow to be practical.</p>
<p>PBFT works through three phases &#40;similar to Paxos but with extra rounds to catch Byzantine behavior&#41;:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pre-prepare</strong>: Leader proposes a value with sequence number</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare</strong>: All nodes broadcast what they received &#40;catches equivocation - if leader sent different values to different nodes, this reveals it&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commit</strong>: Once nodes see matching prepares from \(2f + 1\) nodes, they broadcast commit</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Execute</strong>: Once \(2f + 1\) matching commits seen, execute the operation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The extra communication rounds &#40;compared to crash-tolerant consensus&#41; are needed to detect and work around Byzantine nodes lying to different neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#39;s a Byzantine node?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, &quot;Byzantine&quot; is just the technical term for a node exhibiting arbitrary malicious or faulty behavior. The name comes from the &quot;Byzantine Generals Problem&quot; - imagine generals surrounding a city, needing to agree on whether to attack or retreat. Some generals might be traitors trying to cause confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Byzantine fault</strong> &#61; worst-case arbitrary behavior. A Byzantine node can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lie arbitrarily</strong>: Send &quot;value &#61; 5&quot; to Alice, &quot;value &#61; 9&quot; to Bob</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Crash at convenient times</strong>: Fail right after spreading misinformation</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Equivocate</strong>: Claim &quot;I voted yes&quot; to some nodes, &quot;I voted no&quot; to others</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Collude</strong>: Coordinate with other Byzantine nodes to maximize damage</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ignore protocol</strong>: Send garbage, replay old messages, stay silent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, Byzantine nodes have <strong>unlimited computational power</strong> in the model - they can break any cryptographic assumption. The only thing they can&#39;t do is forge digital signatures &#40;we assume signature schemes are secure&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>Contrast with simpler faults:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crash fault</strong>: Node just stops &#40;think: power outage&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Omission fault</strong>: Node drops messages but otherwise follows protocol</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Byzantine fault</strong>: Arbitrary malicious behavior &#40;could be actual malice, software bugs, or hardware failures that cause random behavior&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Byzantine is the hardest fault model because you can&#39;t distinguish a Byzantine node from an honest one that&#39;s experiencing network issues - it&#39;s adversarially adaptive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if some nodes are Byzantine? Classical BFT &#40;like PBFT&#41; can tolerate up to \(f\) Byzantine nodes out of \(3f + 1\) total nodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why \(3f + 1\) nodes for \(f\) Byzantine faults?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quorum</strong> &#61; the minimum number of nodes that must agree for a decision to be valid. Think of it like a voting threshold - you need responses from at least this many nodes to proceed.</p>
<p>In most systems, quorum &#61; majority &#61; \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1\) nodes. The key property: any two quorums must overlap &#40;share at least one node&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>Why quorums matter</strong>: If you make decisions based on quorum responses, and any two quorums overlap, then information can&#39;t be lost or inconsistent - at least one node saw both decisions.</p>
<p>Intuition for \(3f + 1\): You need enough honest nodes that they outnumber Byzantine nodes in any quorum intersection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quorum size: \(2f + 1\) &#40;majority of \(3f + 1\)&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two quorums must overlap by at least: \((2f + 1) + (2f + 1) - (3f + 1) = f + 1\) nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p>If at most \(f\) nodes are Byzantine, the intersection has at least 1 honest node</p>
</li>
<li><p>This honest node ensures both quorums saw consistent information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why not \(2f + 1\) total nodes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>With \(2f + 1\) nodes, quorums are size \(f + 1\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two quorums could intersect in exactly \(f + 1\) nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p>If all \(f\) Byzantine nodes are in the intersection, you can&#39;t tell if the quorum is honest</p>
</li>
<li><p>Byzantine nodes could make one quorum think &quot;decided A&quot; and another think &quot;decided B&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concrete example</strong> with \(f = 1\) &#40;one traitor&#41;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Need \(3(1) + 1 = 4\) nodes total</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quorum &#61; 3 nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any two quorums overlap by at least 2 nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most 1 Byzantine, so intersection has at least 1 honest node ✓</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With only 3 nodes and \(f=1\): quorums of size 2 could intersect in just 1 node, which might be the Byzantine one ✗</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where blockchains come in.</p>
<p><strong>Graph view</strong>: Byzantine nodes are <strong>adversarial vertices</strong> that can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Send different messages along different edges &#40;lie to different neighbors&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collude with other Byzantine nodes &#40;form adversarial subgraph&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to partition the graph or create inconsistent views</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The \(3f + 1\) requirement means you need enough honest nodes that any two quorums &#40;majorities&#41; share at least \(f + 1\) nodes, guaranteeing at least one honest node in the intersection. This prevents adversarial subgraphs from creating divergent views of the system state.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Distributed ledger</strong>: Everyone maintains a copy of the transaction history</p>

<li><p>Attacking requires 51&#37; of total compute power</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s essentially converting the Byzantine problem into an economic game - attacking costs more than it&#39;s worth.</p>
<p><strong>Graph insight</strong>: Instead of counting nodes &#40;which can be faked via sybil attacks - creating many fake vertices&#41;, Bitcoin weights by computational power. The &quot;real&quot; graph is weighted by hash rate, not vertex count. An adversary must control &gt;50&#37; of the total edge weight &#40;hash power&#41; in the network to consistently win the longest chain race.</p>

<p>Like CAP, blockchains face tradeoffs between:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Many independent nodes</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>: Resistance to attacks</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Transaction throughput</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin chose decentralization &#43; security, sacrificing scalability &#40;~7 tx/sec&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="modern_alternatives"><a href="#modern_alternatives" class="header-anchor">Modern Alternatives</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Proof of Stake</strong>: Replace computation with economic stake &#40;Ethereum 2.0&#41; - graph weighted by staked tokens instead of hash power</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DAGs</strong>: Directed acyclic graphs instead of chains &#40;IOTA, Hedera&#41; - embrace the natural DAG structure rather than forcing linearization</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sharding</strong>: Partition the network to parallelize &#40;Ethereum, Polkadot&#41; - split the graph into subgraphs that process transactions in parallel</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Layer 2</strong>: Do most transactions off-chain, settle on-chain &#40;Lightning Network&#41; - create overlay networks &#40;graphs on top of graphs&#41; for fast local transactions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_connection"><a href="#the_connection" class="header-anchor">The Connection</a></h2>
<p>Blockchains are a specific type of distributed system that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Optimize for <strong>trustlessness</strong> over performance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <strong>incentive mechanisms</strong> &#40;economics&#41; to enforce correct behavior</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prioritize <strong>immutability</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional distributed systems &#40;like databases&#41; assume a trusted environment and optimize for performance and consistency. Blockchains assume an adversarial environment and optimize for security and decentralization.</p>
<p>From a theoretical CS perspective, blockchains showed that you can achieve consensus in a permissionless setting - anyone can join without identity verification. Classical BFT protocols required knowing the set of participants ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>Graph theory connection</strong>: Most distributed systems assume a <strong>known, static graph</strong> &#40;you know all nodes and their connections&#41;. Blockchains solve consensus on <strong>unknown, dynamic graphs</strong> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topology changes constantly &#40;nodes join/leave&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adversary can spawn unlimited fake nodes &#40;sybil attacks&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>You only see your local neighborhood, not global structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Network delays create temporarily inconsistent views of the graph state</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why blockchains are so much slower - they&#39;re solving a fundamentally harder graph problem.</p>

<h3 id="the_mindset_shift"><a href="#the_mindset_shift" class="header-anchor">The Mindset Shift</a></h3>
<p>Most CS education teaches you to think about programs running on one machine with perfect execution. Distributed systems forces you to think fundamentally differently:</p>
<p><strong>From deterministic to probabilistic</strong>: Your code doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; or &quot;not work&quot; - it works with some probability under some failure conditions. You start reasoning about liveness &#40;eventually makes progress&#41; vs. safety &#40;never does the wrong thing&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>From correctness to tradeoffs</strong>: There&#39;s no &quot;correct&quot; distributed system, only tradeoffs. You learn to articulate: &quot;This design gives strong consistency but sacrifices 20&#37; throughput&quot; or &quot;This approach is partition-tolerant but eventually consistent.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>From debugging to reasoning</strong>: You can&#39;t step through a distributed system with a debugger when five machines are running simultaneously. You learn to reason about systems formally - invariants, state machines, message orderings. It&#39;s closer to mathematical proof than traditional debugging.</p>
<h3 id="what_you_actually_gain"><a href="#what_you_actually_gain" class="header-anchor">What You Actually Gain</a></h3>
<p>After a distributed systems course, you develop intuitions that other developers lack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Failure thinking</strong>: You instinctively ask &quot;what if this node crashes right here?&quot; for any design. You see failure modes others miss.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability reasoning</strong>: You can estimate: &quot;This design does O&#40;n²&#41; messages per operation, won&#39;t scale past 100 nodes&quot; or &quot;This needs 3 round-trips, adds 300ms latency.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Real-world architecture</strong>: You understand how systems you use daily actually work - how does Google Spanner provide global consistency? Why does DynamoDB choose eventual consistency? How does Kafka guarantee ordering?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The &quot;distributed systems smell&quot;</strong>: You recognize when someone&#39;s design won&#39;t work at scale. You&#39;ve seen enough consensus algorithms to know when someone&#39;s &quot;simple new protocol&quot; is reinventing Paxos badly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="career_impact"><a href="#career_impact" class="header-anchor">Career Impact</a></h3>
<p>This knowledge puts you in a different tier for certain roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure engineering</strong>: You can actually design the systems &#40;databases, message queues, storage systems&#41; rather than just use them</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Big tech interviews</strong>: Companies like Google, Amazon, Meta heavily weight distributed systems in senior interviews</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Startup CTO/architect</strong>: You can make informed decisions about CAP tradeoffs, not just cargo-cult &quot;use MongoDB because it scales&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Research</strong>: If you go into systems research, this is foundational - ML systems, databases, cloud computing all build on these primitives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the_humility_factor"><a href="#the_humility_factor" class="header-anchor">The Humility Factor</a></h3>
<p>Paradoxically, studying distributed systems makes you more cautious. You&#39;ve seen so many subtle bugs and edge cases that you become skeptical of &quot;simple&quot; solutions to hard problems. When someone proposes a new blockchain or database, you immediately think: &quot;Did they handle split-brain? What about the two-generals problem?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the difference between a developer who thinks &quot;I&#39;ll just add a cache&quot; and one who thinks &quot;I&#39;ll add a cache, but invalidation is hard - what consistency model do I need? What if the cache and DB disagree? What&#39;s my failure mode?&quot;</p>
